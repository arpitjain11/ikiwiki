Use ./Makefile.PL to generate a Makefile, "make" will build the
documentation wiki and a man page, and "make install" will install ikiwiki.

A few special variables you can set while using the Makefile:

PROFILE=1 turns on profiling for the build of the doc wiki. Uses Devel::Profile

NOTAINT=0 turns on the taint flag in the ikiwiki program. (Not recommended
unless your perl is less buggy than mine -- see
http://bugs.debian.org/411786)

There are also other variables supported by MakeMaker, including PREFIX,
INSTALL_BASE, and DESTDIR. See ExtUtils::MakeMaker(3).

In particular, INSTALL_BASE is very useful if you want to install ikiwiki
to some other location, as it configures it to see the perl libraries
there. See `doc/tips/nearlyfreespeech.mdwn` for an example of using this to
install ikiwiki and its dependencies in a home directory.

All other documentation is in the ikiwiki documentation wiki, which is also
available online at <http://ikiwiki.info/>
