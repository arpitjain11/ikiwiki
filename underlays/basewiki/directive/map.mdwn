The `map` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/map]] plugin.

This directive generates a hierarchical page map for the wiki. Example usage:

	\[[!map pages="* and !blog/* and !*/Discussion"]]

If the pages to include are not specified, all pages (and other files) in
the wiki are mapped.

By default, the names of pages are shown in the map. The `show` parameter
can be used to show the titles or descriptions of pages instead (as set by
the [[meta]] plugin). For example:

	\[[!map pages="* and !blog/* and !*/Discussion" show=title]]

Hint: To limit the map to displaying pages less than a certain level deep,
use a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] like this: `pages="* and !*/*/*"`
