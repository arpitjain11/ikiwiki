The `pagetemplate` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/pagetemplate]] plugin.

This directive allows a page to be created using a different
wikitemplates. The page text is inserted into the template, so
the template controls the overall look and feel of the wiki page. This is
in contrast to the [[ikiwiki/directive/template]] directive, which allows inserting templates
_into_ the body of a page.

This directive can only reference templates that are already installed
by the system administrator. Example:

	\[[!pagetemplate template=my_fancy.tmpl]]
