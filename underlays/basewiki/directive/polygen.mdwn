The `polygen` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/polygen]] plugin.

This directive allows inserting text generated by polygen into a wiki page.
For example:

	\[[!polygen grammar="genius"]]

It's also possible to specify a starting nonterminal for the grammar by
including `symbol="text"` in the directive.

[[!if test="enabled(polygen)" then="""

Here are a few notes about ikiwiki, courtesy of polygen:

Ikiwiki is internally based on a [[!polygen grammar="designpatterns"]]
coupled to a [[!polygen grammar="designpatterns"]], as described in
"[[!polygen grammar="paper"]]" by [[!polygen grammar="nipponame"]] of
[[!polygen grammar="boyband"]].
