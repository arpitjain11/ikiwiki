The `template` directive is supplied by the [[!iki plugins/template]] plugin.

[[Templates]] are files that can be filled out and inserted into pages in the
wiki, by using the template directive. The directive has an `id` parameter
that identifies the template to use. The remaining parameters are used to
fill out the template.

Example:

	\[[!template id=note text="""Here is the text to insert into my note."""]]

This fills out the `note` template, filling in the `text` field with
the specified value, and inserts the result into the page.

For a list of available templates, and details about how to create more,
see the [[templates]] page.
