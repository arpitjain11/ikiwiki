Hi All;

I'm trying to use a filter hook as part of making [[wikilinks|ikiwiki/wikilink]] work in [[plugins/contrib/tex4ht]].
It seems that filter is called for every page. For my application I just want it to be called for ".tex" files, 
but right now I have to have a look at the content, which I don't like so much.

Is there a better hook to use for this? I need to transform the input before preprocessing.
