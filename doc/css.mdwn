## Using CSS with ikiwiki

Ikiwiki comes with two CSS stylesheets: [[style.css]] and [[local.css]].
The idea is to customize the second one overriding the first one and
defining brand new rendering rules.

While ikiwiki's default use of stylesheets is intentionally quite plain and
minimalistic, CSS allows creating any kind of look you can dream up.

The [[css_market]] page is an attempt to collect user contributed local.css
files.
