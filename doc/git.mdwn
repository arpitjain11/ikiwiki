Ikiwiki, and this documentation wiki, are developed in a git repository and
can be checked out like this:

[[!template id=note text="""
You can push changes back to ikiwiki's git repository over the `git://`
transport, to update this wiki, if you'd like, instead of editing it on the
web. Changes that could not be made via the web will be automatically
rejected.
"""]]

	git clone git://git.ikiwiki.info/

Or like this if your firewall only passes http traffic (slow):

	git clone http://git.ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki.git/

The gitweb is [here](http://git.ikiwiki.info/?p=ikiwiki).

Commits to this git repository are fed into [CIA](http://cia.vc), and can
be browsed, subscribed to etc on its
[project page](http://cia.vc/stats/project/ikiwiki). They're also fed into
[twitter](http://twitter.com/ikiwiki).

## personal git repositories

You are of course free to set up your own ikiwiki git repository with your
own [[patches|patch]]. If you list it here, the `gitremotes` script will
automatically add it to git remotes. Your repo will automatically be pulled
into [[Joey]]'s working tree. This is recommended. :-)

## branches

Some of the branches included in the main repository include:

* `gallery` contains the [[todo/Gallery]] plugin. It's not yet merged
  due to license issues.  Also some bits need to be tweaked to make it
  work with the current *master* branch again.
* `html` is an unfinished attempt at making ikiwiki output HTML 4.01
  instead of xhtml.
* `wikiwyg` adds [[todo/wikiwyg]] support. It is unmerged pending some
  changes.
* `darcs` is being used to add darcs support.
* `debian-stable` is used for updates to the old version included in
  Debian's stable release, and `debian-testing` is used for updates to
  Debian's testing release.
* `pristine-tar` contains deltas that
  [pristine-tar](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/pristine-tar)
  can use to recreate released tarballs of ikiwiki
