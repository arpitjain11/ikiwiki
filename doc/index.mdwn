Ikiwiki is a **wiki compiler**. It converts wiki pages into HTML pages
suitable for publishing on a website. Ikiwiki stores pages and history in a
[[revision_control_system|rcs]] such as [[Subversion|rcs/svn]] or [[rcs/Git]].
There are many other [[features]], including support for
[[blogging|blog]], as well as a large array of [[plugins]].
