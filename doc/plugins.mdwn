Most of ikiwiki's [[features]] are implemented as plugins. Many of these 
plugins are included with ikiwiki.

[[map pages="plugins/*" show=description]]

[[pagestats pages="plugins/type/* and !plugins/type/slow"]]

There's documentation if you want to [[write]] your own plugins, or you can
[[install]] plugins [[contributed|contrib]] by others.

To enable a plugin, use the `--plugin` switch described in
[[usage]], or the equivalent `add_plugins` line in [[ikiwiki.setup]].
Enable the [[goodstuff]] plugin to get a nice selection of plugins that
will fit most uses of ikiwiki.
