This is an [[example_blog|index]]. Just copy the blog subdirectory into
your wiki to quickly get started blogging with ikiwiki. 

Or, run this command to set up a blog with ikiwiki.

	% ikiwiki -setup /etc/ikiwiki/auto-blog.setup

Some additional configuration you might want to do:

* Make sure to configure ikiwiki to generate RSS or Atom feeds.

* Make sure you have the tag plugin enabled, and tag posts using it. An
  example of how to tag a post is:
	\[[!tag tags/life]]

* Enable the [[sidebar|plugins/sidebar]] plugin to get a sidebar listing all
  the categories you've tagged posts with.

* Enable the [[pagestats|plugins/pagestats]] plugin to get a tag cloud
  to display on the [[index]].

* Enable the [[comments|plugins/comments]] plugin and configure it to
  enable comments to posts to the blog:

  	comments_pagespec => 'blog/posts/* and !*/Discussion',
