[[!meta title="Revision Control Systems"]]

Ikiwiki supports using several revision control systems for storing page
histories. 

Ikiwiki started out supporting only [[Subversion|svn]], but the interface
ikiwiki uses to a revision control system is sufficiently simple and
generic that it can be adapted to work with many systems by writing a
[[plugin|plugins/write]]. [[Subversion|svn]] is still a recommended choice;
[[git]] is another well-tested option.

These are all the supported revision control systems:
[[!inline pages="rcs/* and !*/Discussion and !rcs/details" archive=yes]]

There is a page with [[details]] about how the different systems work with
ikiwiki, for the curious.
