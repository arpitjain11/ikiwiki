The ikiwiki project strongly encourages collaboration through ikiwiki itself,
and thus does not have a mailing list.  Anyone can create an account on
ikiwiki's own wiki. ikiwiki provides a [[bug_tracker|bugs]], a
[[TODO_list|TODO]], and "discussion" sub-pages for every page, as well as a
[[forum]] for general questions and discussion. ikiwiki
developers monitor [[RecentChanges]] closely, via the webpage, email,
[CIA](http://cia.navi.cx), and IRC, and respond in a timely fashion.

You could also drop by the IRC channel `#ikiwiki` on
[OFTC](http://www.oftc.net/) (`irc.oftc.net`), or use the
[identi.ca ikiwiki group](http://identi.ca/group/ikiwiki).
