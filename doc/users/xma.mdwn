# Xavier Maillard

I just started using [[ikiwiki]] for my own webspace at http://maillard.mobi/~xma/wiki

I am learning how to effectively use it.

Anyway, [[ikiwiki]] is really *awesome* !

## More about me

I am CLI user living in the linux console. More precisely, I live in an [[GNU_Emacs]] frame all day long. My main computer is an EeePC 901 running Slackware GNU/Linux 12.1. I do not have X installed (too lazy) but when in X, I am running an instance of [[CLFSWM]].

## Contacting me

Various channels to contact me:

- mail: xma@gnu.org
- jabber: xma01@jabber.fr
- mobile: +33 621-964-362 (I only anwser to people I know though)

Voila.

## Plans

I am planning to make a presentation of [[ikiwiki]]to my [local LUG](http://lolica.org) for our next montly meeting. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

We are discussing to replace our old unmaintained (and unmaintainable) [SPIP](http://spip.net) website with a wiki. This is why I would like using ikiwiki ;)
