It's possible to use all of ikiwiki's web features (page editing, etc) in
the `w3m` web browser without using a web server. `w3m` supports local CGI
scripts, and ikiwiki can be set up to run that way. This requires some
special configuration:

 * `w3mmode` must be enabled
 * A CGI wrapper must be created, in ~/.ikiwiki/wrappers/
 * `cgiurl` should be set to just the base of the filename of the CGI
   wrapper.

This [[ikiwiki.setup]] is an example of setting up a wiki using w3mmode.
