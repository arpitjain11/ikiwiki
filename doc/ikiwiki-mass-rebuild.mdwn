# NAME

ikiwiki-mass-rebuild - rebuild all ikiwiki wikis on a system

# SYNOPSIS

ikiwiki-mass-rebuild

# DESCRIPTION

`ikiwiki-mass-rebuild` can be used to force a rebuild of all the wikis
on a system. You will need to list the wikis it should build in the file
`/etc/ikiwiki/wikilist`, which has the format:

user /path/to/wiki

It's also possible to let a user list setup files in `~user/.ikiwiki/wikilist`
in their home directory. To do so, list only the user's name, without a
setup file. The format of `~/.ikiwiki/wikilist` is the same as 
`/etc/ikiwiki/wikilist`.

# OPTIONS

All options are passed on to ikiwiki.
