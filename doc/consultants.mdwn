Ikiwiki is free software, worked on by various people to "scratch their
itch". Some people either don't have the time or have specialized needs and
are willing to hire someone to either maintain or add additional
functionality to ikiwiki. The following is a list of people who are
available to do consulting or other work on ikiwiki.
