This plugin adds antispam support to ikiwiki, using the
[blogspam.net](http://blogspam.net/) API. Both page edits and
[[comment|comments]] postings can be checked for spam. Page edits that
appear to contain spam will be rejected; comments that look spammy will be
stored in a queue for moderation by an admin.

The plugin requires the [[!cpan RPC::XML]] perl module.

You can control how content is tested via the `blogspam_options` setting.
The list of options is [here](http://blogspam.net/api/testComment.html#options).
By default, the options are configured in a way that is appropriate for
wiki content. This includes turning off some of the more problimatic tests.

The `blogspam_pagespec` setting is a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] that can be
used to configure which pages are checked for spam. The default is to check
all edits. If you only want to check [[comments]] (not wiki page edits),
set it to "postcomment(*)".

By default, the blogspam.net server is used to do the spam checking. To
change this, the `blogspam_server` option can be set to the url for a
different server implementing the same API. Note that content is sent
unencrypted over the internet to the server, and the server sees
the full text of the content.
