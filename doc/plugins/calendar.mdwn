This plugin provides a [[ikiwiki/directive/calendar]] [[ikiwiki/directive]].
The directive displays a calendar, similar to the typical calendars shown on
some blogs.

Since ikiwiki is a wiki compiler, to keep the calendar up-to-date,
wikis that include it need to be periodically refreshes, typically by cron
at midnight. Example crontab:

	0 0 * * * ikiwiki -setup ~/ikiwiki.setup -refresh

## CSS

The output is liberally sprinkled with classes, for fine grained CSS
customization.

* `month-calendar` - The month calendar as a whole.
* `month-calendar-head` - The head of the month calendar (ie,"March").
* `month-calendar-day-head` - A column head in the month calendar (ie, a
  day-of-week abbreviation).
* `month-calendar-day-noday`, `month-calendar-day-link`,
  `month-calendar-day-nolink`, `month-calendar-day-future`,
  `month-calendar-day-this-day` - The day squares on the month calendar,
  for days that are not in the month (before or after the month itself), that
  don't have links, that do have links, that are in the future, or are that
  are the current day, respectively.
* `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, ... - Each day square is also given a class
  matching its  (localised) day of week, this can be used to highlight
  weekends.
* `year-calendar` - The year calendar as a whole.
* `year-calendar-head` - The head of the year calendar (ie, "2007").
* `year-calendar-subhead` - For example, "Months".
* `year-calendar-month-link`, `year-calendar-month-nolink`,
  `year-calendar-month-future`, `year-calendar-this-month` - The month
  squares on the year calendar, for months with stories,
  without, in the future, and currently selected, respectively.
