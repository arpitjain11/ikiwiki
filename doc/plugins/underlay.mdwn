This plugin adds an `add_underlays` option to the `.setup` file.
Its value is a list of underlay directories whose content is added to the wiki.

Multiple underlays are normally set up automatically by other plugins (for
instance, the images used by the [[plugins/smiley]] plugin), but they can also be
used as a way to pull in external files that you don't want in revision control,
like photos or software releases.

Directories in `add_underlays` should usually be absolute. If relative, they're
interpreted as relative to the parent directory of the basewiki underlay, which
is probably not particularly useful in this context.
