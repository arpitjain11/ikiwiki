replaced with the total number of pages currently in the wiki.

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] specifying the
pages to count, default is to count them all.

This plugin is included in ikiwiki, but is not enabled by default.

pages, of which [[pagecount pages="*/Discussion"]] are discussion pages.
