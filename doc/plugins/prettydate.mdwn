Enabling this plugin changes the dates displayed on pages in the wiki to
a format that is nice and easy to read. Examples: "late Wednesday evening, 
February 14th, 2007", "at midnight, March 15th, 2007"

The names given to each of the hours in the day can be customised by
setting the `timetable` configuration variable in ikiwiki's setup file.
The default value of this configuration value can be seen near the top of
`prettydate.pm`. Note that an hour can be left blank, to make it display the
same as the hour before. Midnight, noon, and teatime are all hardcoded,
since they do not occupy the whole hour.

The format used for the date can be customised using the `prettydateformat`
configuration variable in the setup file. `%X` will be expanded to the
prettified time value. The default prettydateformat is `"%X, %B %o, %Y"`.

This plugin uses the [[!cpan TimeDate]] perl module.
