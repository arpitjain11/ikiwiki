This plugin adds a `do=goto` mode for the IkiWiki CGI script. It's mainly
for internal use by the [[404]], [[comments]] and [[recentchanges]]
plugins, which enable it automatically.

With this plugin enabled you can link to `ikiwiki.cgi?do=goto&page=some/where`
to make a link that will redirect to the page `/some/where` if it exists, or
offer a link to create it if it doesn't.
