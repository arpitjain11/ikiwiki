This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/sparkline]]
[[ikiwiki/directive]], which allows for easily embedding sparklines into
wiki pages. A sparkline is a small word-size graphic chart, that is designed
to be displayed alongside text.

# requirements

The plugin uses the [Sparkline PHP Graphing Library](http://sparkline.org/)
as it has better output than the native perl sparkline library. Therefore,
to use the plugin, you will need:

* The Sparkline PHP Graphing Library, installed in php's path so that
  php can find it when `sparkline/Sparkline.php` is required.
* The GD PHP module used by the Sparkline library.
* A "php" program in the path, that can run standalone php programs.
* [[!cpan Digest::SHA1]]

On a Debian system, this can be accomplished by installing these packages:
`libsparkline-php` `php5-gd` `php5-cli` `libdigest-sha1-perl`
