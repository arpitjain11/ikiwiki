This plugin, also known as
[SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/), translates
plain ASCII punctuation characters into ``smart'' typographic punctuation HTML
entities. To use it, you need to have the [[!cpan Text::Typography]] module
installed.

This plugin has a configuration option. To change the attributes,
set `--typographyattributes=whatever`. See the documentation for
[[!cpan Text::Typography]] for available attributes.
