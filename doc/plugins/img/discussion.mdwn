It would be useful (at least for me) if one could specify
(using a [[ikiwiki/WikiLink]]) where the image links to.  For example,
on <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/sidebar/> I'd like to have the
logo link to \[[hurd/logo]] / <http://www.bddebian.com/~wiki/hurd/logo/>
instead of linking to the PNG image file.  --[[tschwinge]]

It would be handy if the `class` and `id` tags were passed through to the surrounding `table` in the case of `caption` being present.  Would this break anything?  --[[neale]]
