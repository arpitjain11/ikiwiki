This plugin lets ikwiki convert files with names ending in ".mdwn" to html.
It uses the [[ikiwiki/markdown]] minimal markup language.

This is the standard markup language used by ikiwiki, although some others
are also available in other plugins.

There are several implementations of markdown support that can be used by
this plugin. The [original version of
markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) can be used, or the
[[cpan Text::Markdown]] perl module.

[[cpan Text::Markdown]] also includes a markdown variant called
[multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/MultiMarkdown/), which supports
tables, footnotes, and other new features. Multimarkdown is not enabled by
default, but can be turned on via the `multimarkdown` option in the setup
file. Note that multimarkdown's metadata and wikilinks features are
disabled when it's used with ikiwiki.
