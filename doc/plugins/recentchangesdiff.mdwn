[[template id=plugin name=recentchangesdiff core=0 author="[[Joey]]"]]

This plugin extends the [[recentchanges]] plugin, adding a diff for each
change. The diffs are by default hidden from display on the recentchanges
page, but will display in its feeds. The [[rcs]] must have implemented
support for the `rcs_diff()` function for any diffs to be generated.
