Maybe we can have a page for requesting a plugin? (Not from the head developer but other ikiwiki end-users.)

I have seen a few requests on discussion pages, but not any place specific I think.

It would be nice if the page gave a brief synopsis for each plugin.  For example:

>headinganchors  
>Adds IDs to all headings based on their text.  
>Posted Thu, 09 Aug 2007 02:34:19 -0400  

>pagetemplate  
>Inserts page text into chosen template with the template controlling the look and feel.  
>Posted Thu, 26 Jul 2007 16:50:58 -0400  

>graphviz  
>Allows embedding of graphviz graphs.  
>Posted Mon, 09 Apr 2007 05:09:04 -0400

Any objections to listing plugins alphabetically rather than by creation date?  (i.e. change the inline to have sort="title".)
