[[!template id=plugin name=navbar author="[[TobiOetiker]]"]]

The Navbar Plugin renders a Navigation Bar into your page. It is based on code
from the [[sidebar_plugin|plugins/sidebar]].

The plugin looks for a page called "navbar" 

This page must contain a itemized list of the form


    * \[[Welcome|index]]
    * \[[Management|mgmt]] 
      * \[[Leadership|mgmt/lead]]       
      * \[[Kidnapping|mgmt/kidnapping]]          
    * \[[Information_Technology|it]]  
      * \[[Windows|it/windows]]
      * \[[Mobile_Communication|it/mobile]] 

This list will be turned into a folding menu structure

Include this into your templates.

    <TMPL_IF NAVBAR> 
    <div id="navbar">
    <TMPL_VAR NAVBAR>
    </div>
    </TMPL_IF>


To make a nice menu, some css magic is required, but since this is required to make
ikiwiki look good anyway, I won't go into details here ...
