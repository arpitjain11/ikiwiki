[[!tag type/useful]]

This plugin allows content from other feeds to be aggregated into the
wiki. To specify feeds to aggregate, use the
[[ikiwiki/directive/aggregate]] [[ikiwiki/directive]].

The [[meta]] and [[tag]] plugins are also recommended. Either the
[[htmltidy]] or [[htmlbalance]] plugin is suggested, since feeds can easily
contain html problems, some of which these plugins can fix.

You will need to run ikiwiki periodically from a cron job, passing it the
--aggregate parameter, to make it check for new posts. Here's an example
crontab entry:

	*/15 * * * * ikiwiki --setup my.wiki --aggregate --refresh

Alternatively, you can allow `ikiwiki.cgi` to trigger the aggregation. You
should only need this if for some reason you cannot use cron, and instead
want to use a service such as [WebCron](http://webcron.org). To enable
this, turn on `aggregate_webtrigger` in your setup file. The url to
visit is `http://whatever/ikiwiki.cgi?do=aggregate_webtrigger`. Anyone
can visit the url to trigger an aggregation run, but it will only check
each feed if its `updateinterval` has passed.

## aggregated pages

This plugin creates a page for each aggregated item. 

If the `aggregateinternal` option is enabled in the setup file (which is
the default), aggregated pages are stored in the source directory with a
"._aggregated" extension. These pages cannot be edited by web users, and
do not generate first-class wiki pages. They can still be inlined into a
blog, but you have to use `internal` in [[PageSpecs|IkiWiki/PageSpec]],
like `internal(blog/*)`.

If `aggregateinternal` is disabled, you will need to enable the [[html]]
plugin as well as aggregate itself, since feed entries will be stored as
HTML, and as first-class wiki pages -- each one generates
a separate HTML page in the output, and they can even be edited. This
option is provided only for backwards compatability.
