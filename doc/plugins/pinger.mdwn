This plugin allows ikiwiki to be configured to hit a URL each time it
updates the wiki. One way to use this is in conjunction with the [[pingee]]
plugin to set up a loosely coupled mirror network, or a branched version of
a wiki. By pinging the mirror or branch each time the main wiki changes, it
can be kept up-to-date.

To configure what URLs to ping, use the [[ikiwiki/directive/ping]]
[[ikiwiki/directive]].

The [[!cpan LWP]] perl module is used for pinging. Or the [[!cpan
LWPx::ParanoidAgent]] perl module is used if available, for added security.
Finally, the [[!cpan Crypt::SSLeay]] perl module is needed to support pinging
"https" urls.

By default the pinger will try to ping a site for 15 seconds before timing
out. This timeout can be changed by setting the `pinger_timeout`
configuration setting in the setup file.
