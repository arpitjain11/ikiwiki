This plugin adds full text search to ikiwiki, using the
[xapian](http://xapian.org/) engine, its
[omega](http://xapian.org/docs/omega/overview.html) frontend, and the
[[cpan Search::Xapian]], [[cpan Digest::SHA1]], and [[cpan HTML::Scrubber]]
perl modules.

The [[ikiwiki/searching]] page describes how to write search queries.

Ikiwiki will handle indexing new and changed page contents. Note that since
it only indexes page contents, files copied by the [[rawhtml]] plugin will
not be indexed, nor will other types of data files.

There is one setting you may need to use in the config file. `omega_cgi` 
should point to the location of the omega cgi program. The default location
is `/usr/lib/cgi-bin/omega/omega`.
