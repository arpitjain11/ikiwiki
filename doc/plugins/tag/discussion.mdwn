I'd like to modify this plugin such that the tag pages are automatically created and populated with a list of relevant posts. The content of the tag page is simply `"\[[!inline pages="link(tag/$tag)"]]`. The tag plugin will have to determine whether a page for the given tag already exists, and if not use that Markdown fragment to  generate it.

There are clearly many ways to do this, but any opinions on which is the cleanest?

It might work to use the 'change' hook, since that's called at the very end
of `refresh()`. The hook could add the tag pages and re-run `refresh()`,
taking appropriate care to avoid looping forever.

Thanks. That works fine.

@Ben: could you publish the code for that?

Please make the actual text used a template some way or another. I may want `map` instead of `inline`. --[[madduck]]
