This plugin generates a list of broken links on pages in the wiki. This is
a useful way to find pages that still need to be written, or links that
are written wrong.

The optional parameter "pages" can be a [[ikiwiki/PageSpec]] specifying the
pages to search for broken links, default is search them all.

If this plugin is turned on, here's a list of broken links on this wiki:

[[brokenlinks pages="* and !recentchanges"]]
