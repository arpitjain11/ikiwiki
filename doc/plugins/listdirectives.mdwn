This plugin provides the [[ikiwiki/directive/linkmap]]
[[ikiwiki/directive]], which inserts a list of currently available
directives into the page.

Each directive links to a wiki page with the same name, that should
document that directive. The location of these pages can be controlled via
the `directive_description_dir` setting in the setup file, the default is
"ikiwiki/directive/foo".

When this plugin is enabled, it enables the directives underlay, which
contains documentation about all the directives included in plugins shipped
with ikiwiki. This adds about 200 kb to the size of your wiki.
