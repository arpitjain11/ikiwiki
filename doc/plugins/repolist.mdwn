This plugin allows you to configure ikiwiki with the location of
[[rcs]] repositories for your wiki's source. This is done via the
"repositories" setting in the setup file. Once you tell it where the source
to your wiki can be downloaded from, this information can be published on
your wiki in various ways.

This plugin supports the [rel-vcs-*](http://kitenet.net/~joey/rfc/rel-vcs/)
microformat, and uses it to embed the repository location information in
every wiki page.

By using this plugin, you will make [[Joey]] very happy, as he will be able
to easily check out the source of your wiki, for purposes of debugging and
general curiosity. More generally, making it easy for others to find the
repository for your wiki is just a Plain Good Idea(TM).
