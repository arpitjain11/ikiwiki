I've started using git as ikiwiki's main repository. See [[download]] for
repository locations.

Note that all the sha1sums have changed from those in previously published
git repositories. Blame [git-svnimport](http://bugs.debian.org/447965).

I hope that this will make it easier to maintain and submit patches for
ikiwiki.
