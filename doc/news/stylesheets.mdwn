Some people may consider ikiwiki's default look to be a bit plain. Someone
on slashdot even suggested perhaps it uses html 1.0. (Yes, an ikiwiki site
has survived its first slashdotting. With static html, that's not very
hard..) While the default style is indeed plain, there's more fine-tuning
going on than you might think, and it's actually all done with xhtml and
style sheets.

Stefano Zacchiroli came up with the idea of adding a [[css_market]] page
where [[IkiWikiUsers]] can share style sheets that you've come up with for
ikiwiki. This is a great idea and I encourage those of you who have
customised stylesheets to post them.

I'm also always looking for minimalistic yet refined additions to the default
style sheet, and always appreciate suggestions for it.
