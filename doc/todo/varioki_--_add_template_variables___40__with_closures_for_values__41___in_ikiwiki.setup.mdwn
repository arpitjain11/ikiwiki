varioki - Add variables for use in ikiwiki templates

This plugin attempts to provide a means to add templates for use in ikiwiki templates, based on a hash variable set in the ikiwiki configuration file. The motivation for this plugin was to provide an easy way for end users to add information to be used in templates -- for example, my "Blosxom" blog entry template does fancy things with the date components of the entry, and there was no easy way to get that information into the template. Or if one wants to have a different page template for the top level index page than for the rest of the pages inthe wiki (for example, to only put special content, like, say, 'last.fm" play lists, only on the front page).

This plugin hooks itsef into the "pagetemplate" hook, and adds parameters to the appropriate templates based on the type. For example, the following inserted into "ikiwiki.setup" creates "TMPL_VAR MOTTO" and "TOPLVL" which can then be used in your templates.

    varioki => {
      ’motto’    => ’"Manoj\’s musings"’,
      ’toplvl’   => ’sub {return $page eq "index"}’
    },

For every key in the configured hash, the corresponding value is evaluated.  Based on whether the value was a stringified scalar, code, array, or hash, the value of the template parameter is generated on the fly.  The available variables are whatever is available to "pagetemplate" hook scripts, namely, $page, $destpage, and $template.  Additionally, the global variables and functions as defined in the Ikiwiki documentation (<http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/write/>) may be used.

+
+varioki - Add variables for use in ikiwiki templates
+
+=cut
+
+=head1 DESCRIPTION
+
+This plugin attempts to provide a means to add templates for use in
+ikiwiki templates, based on a hash variable set in the ikiwiki
+configuration file. The motivation for this plugin was to provide an
+easy way for end users to add information to be used in templates --
+for example, my C<Blosxom> blog entry template does fancy things with
+the date components of the entry, and there was no easy way to get
+that information into the template. Or if one wants to have a
+different page template for the top level index page than for the rest
+of the pages in the wiki (for example, to only put special content,
+like, say, C<last.fm> play lists, only on the front page).
+
+This plugin hooks itsef into the C<pagetemplate> hook, and adds
+parameters to the appropriate templates based on the type. For
+example, the following inseted into C<ikiwiki.setup> creates
+C<TMPL_VAR MOTTO>, C<ARRAYVAR>, C<HASHVAR> and C<TOPLVL> which can
+then be used in your templates. The array and hash variables are only
+for completeness; I suspect that the first two forms are all that are
+really required.
+
+ varioki => {
+   'motto'    => '"Manoj\'s musings"',
+   'toplvl'   => 'sub {return $page eq "index"}',
+   'arrayvar' => '[0, 1, 2, 3]',
+   'hashvar'  => '{1, 1, 2, 2}'
+ },
+
+Please note that the values in the hash must be simple strings which
+are then eval'd, so a string value has to be double quoted, as above
+(the eval strips off the outer quotes).

+=head1 CAVEATS
+
+This is very inchoate, at the moment, and needs testing. Also, there
+is no good way to determine how to handle hashes as values --
+currently, the code just joins all hash values with spaces, but it
+would be easier for the user to just use an anonymous sub instead of
+passing in a hash or an array.
+
+=cut
+
+=head1 BUGS
+
+Since C<ikiwiki> evals the configuration file, the values have to all
+on a single physical line. This is the reason we need to use strings
+and eval, instead of just passing in real anonymous sub references,
+since the eval pass converts the coderef into a string of the form
+"(CODE 12de345657)" which can't be dereferenced.
