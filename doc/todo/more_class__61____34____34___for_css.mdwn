I'm writing my own CSS for ikiwiki. During this effort I often found the need of adding more class="" attributes to the default ikiwiki templates. This way more presentational aspects of visual formatting can be delegated to CSS and removed from the HTML structure.

In this patch I plan to collect changes in this direction.

The first, one-liner, patch is to use a "div" element with a
class="actions" attribute for inline page as is done with non-inlined page.
This way the same CSS formatting can be applied to div.actions in the CSS,
while at the moment it must be duplicated for a span.actions (which I
believe is also incorrect, since it will contain a "ul" element, not sure
though). In case the markup should be differentiated it will still be
possible relying on the fact that a div.actions is contained or not in a
div.inlinepage.

Here's the one-liner:

The following adds a div element with class="trailer" around the meta-information
added after an inlined page (namely: the post date, the tags, and the actions):

I'd like a class attribute on the `<span>` tag surrounding wikilinks
that refer to non-existent pages, in Ikiwiki.pm:htmllink, so that such
broken links can be styled more dramatically with CSS. --Jamey
