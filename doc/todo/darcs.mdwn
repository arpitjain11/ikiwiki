Here's Thomas Schwinge unfinished darcs support for ikiwiki.

(Finishing this has been suggested as a [[soc]] project.)

This is my ([bma](bma@bmalee.eu)) darcs.pm - it's messy (my Perl isn't up to much) but seems to work. It uses just one repo, like the mercurial plugin (unlike the above version, which AIUI uses two).

`rcs_commit()` uses backticks instead of `system()`, to prevent darcs' output being sent to the browser and mucking with the HTTP headers (`darcs record` has no --quiet option). And `rcs_recentchanges()` uses regexes rather than parsing darcs' XML output.

Well, here's my version too. It only does getctime -- using a real XML parser, instead of regexp ugliness -- and maybe recentchanges, but that may be bitrotted, or maybe I never finished it, as I only need the getctime. As for actual commits, I have previously voiced my opinion, that this should be done by the plugin generating a patch bundle, and forwarding it to darcs in some way (`darcs apply` or even email to another host, possibly moderated), instead of the hacky direct modification of a working copy. It could also be faster to getctime in a batch. Just reading in all the changes the first time they're needed, might not be a big improvement in many cases, but if we got a batch request from ikiwiki, we could keep reaing the changes until all the files in this batch request have been met.  --[[tuomov]]

I merged the two versions above and made some fixes; it is recording my web edits in darcs and showing a recent changes page.
It is in a [darcs repository](http://joyful.com/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=ikiwiki-darcs), please send patches. --[[Simon_Michael]]

> I'd like to see at least the following fixed before I commit this: --[[Joey]]
> * Running `darcs record $filename` in backticks is not good (security)
>   The thing to do is to open stdout to /dev/null before execing darcs.
> * Get `rcs_recentchanges_xml` working, parsing xml with regexps does
>   not seem like a maintenance win.
> * `rcs_notify` should be removed, it's no longer used.
> * Some form of conflict handling. Using darcs to attempt to merge
>   the changes is I gusss optional (although every other rcs backend,
>   including svn manages to do this), but it needs to at *least* detect
>   conflicts and return a page with conflict markers for the user to fix
>   the conflict.

I have addressed the recentchanges bit, you can find my hacked up darcs.pm at <http://web.mornfall.net/stuff/web-root/IkiWiki/Rcs/darcs.pm>.

It's got couple of FIXMEs, and a very site-specific filter for recentchanges. Not sure how to do that better though. I will eventually add web commits, probably of my own (and mention it here).

---

And here's yet another one, including an updated `ikiwiki-makerepo`. :)

<http://khjk.org/~pesco/ikiwiki-darcs/> (now a darcs repo)

> Note that there's a 'darcs' branch in git that I'm keeping a copy of your
> code in. Just in case. :-)

I've taken all the good stuff from the above and added the missing hooks. The code hasn't seen a lot of testing, so some bugs are likely yet to surface. Also, I'm not experienced with perl and don't know where I should have used the function `possibly_foolish_untaint`.

Regarding the repository layout: There are two darcs repositories. One is the `srcdir`, the other we'll call `master`.

 *  HTML is generated from `srcdir`.
 *  CGI edits happen in `srcdir`.
 *  The backend pulls updates from `master` into `srcdir`, i.e. darcs commits should happen to `master`.
 *  `master` calls ikiwiki (through a wrapper) in its apply posthook, i.e. `master/_darcs/prefs/defaults` should look like this:

        apply posthook ikiwrap
        apply run-posthook

    (I'm not sure, should/could it be `ikiwrap --refresh` above?)
 *  The backend pushes CGI edits from `srcdir` back into `master` (triggering the apply hook).
 *  The working copies in `srcdir` and `master` should *not* be touched by the user, only by the CGI or darcs, respectively.

> Review of this one:
> 
> * Should use tab indentation.
> * `rcs_getctime` should not need to use a ctime cache (such a cache should 
>   also not be named `.ikiwiki.ctimes`). `rcs_getctime` is run exactly
>   once per page, ever, and the data is cached in ikiwiki's index.
> * I doubt that ENV{DARCS} will be available, since the wrapper clobbers> the entire
>   environment. I'd say remove that.
> * I don't understand what `darcs_info` is doing, but it seems to be
>   parsing xml with a regexp?
> * Looks like `rcs_commit` needs a few improvements, as marked TODO
> * `rcs_remove` just calls "rm"? Does darcs record notice the file was removed
>    and automatically commit the removal? (And why `system("rm")` and not
>    `unlink`?)
> * Is the the darcs info in [[details]] still up-to-date re this version?
> --[[Joey]]

> Update:
>
> I think I've addressed all of the above except for the XML parsing in `darcs_info`.
> The function determines the md5 hash of the last patch the given file appears in.
> That's indeed being done with regexps but my Perl isn't good enough for a quick recode
> right now.
>
> As for the darcs info in [[rcs/details]], it does not accurately describe the way
> this version works. It's similar, but the details differ slightly.
> You could copy my description above to replace it.
>
> There is still some ironing to do, for instance the current version doesn't allow for
> modifying attachments by re-uploading them via CGI ("darcs add failed"). Am I assuming
> correctly that "adding" a file that's already in the repo should just be a no-op?
> --pesco
