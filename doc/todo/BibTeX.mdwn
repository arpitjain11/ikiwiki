I would *love* to see a plugin that lets you create one or more BibTeX-formatted bibliography pages and add citations to other pages.  The plugin could also render the bibliographies themselves using a chosen BibTeX style and an HTML formatter for LaTeX (such as HeVeA).

I work on a plugin to htmlize '.bib' files.

A sample result is shown on my webpage : <http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/pub/>.

It features the htmlization of the bibtex with 4 types of entry supported (InProceedings, Article, MastersThesis and PhdThesis). I will add the book entry support soon. It creates for each '.bib' file an html version, and for each entry a specific page with abstract as well as an individual bib file. It lack some features like the possibility to have a pdf or ps version of the article attached.

This plugin uses two templates to render the html version of each file.

I have a problem to create a new page that render like any other page in the wiki. I have used the Ikiwiki's internal **genpage($$)** routine but I suppose that there is another way to do this. My method lack the backlink support for the individual entry files as well as the modification date of these file.

Is it possible to create several wiki page from only one source file?

The source of this plugin could be found on this page : <http://alexandre.dupas.free.fr/code/ikiwiki/> .

Feel free to propose any modifications to enhance this plugin.

I have not found any other approach to build several wiki page with only one source file. Does someone have an idea?

I also try to build a wiki-wide preprocessing of the source file to find reference to my bib entry (citation) but apparently there is no wiki-wide preprocessing hook allowing to collect data from each page before building the site. Do I miss something?

What notation did you have in mind for citations?  A preprocessor
directive?  Something LaTeX-inspired might be

    \[[!cite key="foo"]]

which would output "(Foo, 2008)".  With the appropriate options, this
could allow for several variations like "Foo (2008)" and "(Foo, 2008,
p. 28)".  A `nocite` option could cause the reference to be printed in
the bibliography but produce no output.

What about the references section?  There are several ways to
go about it, for example:

1. It could be included at the bottom of the page automatically for
   pages with references, with a configurable title and heading level
   (e.g., `<h2>References</h2>`) followed by a list of references.

2. Use another preprocessor directive like

        ## References ##

        \[[!bibliography ]]

   or

        \[[!bibliography title="References" headerlevel="2"]]

   with configurable default values.  Would it be tedious to do this on
   every page?

3. Use HTML::Template and allow users to add a bibliography section to
   `page.tmpl` to include the bibliography if references are present and
   loop over the references to emit a list.  The downside here is having
   to ask people to modify their templates (unless the plugin is
   eventually included in the distribution).

Any thoughts on the best way to proceed?
