* Is the code sufficiently robust? It just warns when mercurial fails.
* When rcs_commit is called with a $user that is an openid, it will be
  passed through to mercurial -u. Will mercurial choke on this?
 * Nope. Mercurial doesn't expect any particular format for the username, 
   though "Name <address@domain>" is standard. --[[bma]]
* The way `-u $user` is passed to `hg commit`, there's no way to tell
  if a given commit came in over the web or was done directly. So
  rcs_recentchanges hardcodes 'committype => "mercurial"'. See the monotone
  backend for an example of one that does this right.
* The rcs_commit implementation seems not to notice if the file has been
  changed since a web edit started. Unlike all the other frontends, which
  use the rcstoken to detect if the web commit started editing an earlier
  version of the file, and if so, merge the two sets of changes together.
  It seems that with the current mercurial commit code, it will always
  blindly overwrite the current file with the web edited version, losing
  any other changes.

Posthook: in `$srcdir/.hg/hgrc`, I have the following

    [hooks]
    incoming.update = hg up
    update.ikiwiki = ikiwiki --setup /path/to/ikiwiki.setup --refresh

This should update the working directory and run ikiwiki every time a change is recorded (someone who knows mercurial better than I do may be able to suggest a better way, but this works for me.)

The problem with --post-commit is that if you delete some pages in $SRC, ikiwiki --setup setupfile --post-commit will not delete them in $DEST. --[[users/weakish]]

I add the following to .hg/hgrc:(I use changegroup since I don't think we need refresh per changeset, please point out if I am wrong.)

    [hooks]
    changegroup = hg update >&2 && ikiwiki --setup path.to.setup.file --refresh

<p><del>post-commit = ikiwiki --setup path.to.setup.file --refresh</del><strong>This will cause deadlock! See bleow!</strong></p>

***

I have a few notes on mercurial usage after trying it out for a while:

1. I have been using ikiwiki's `--post-commit` option without apparent problems. I'm the only current user of my wiki, though.

1. The `ikiwiki.setup` file included in ikiwiki works with mercurial's `hgserve`, which is not the preferred solution. Mercurial's `hgwebdir.cgi` is more flexible and doesn't require running a server. I have this in my .setup file:

        # Mercurial stuff.
        rcs => "mercurial",
        historyurl => "http://localhost/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/ikiwiki/log/tip/\[[file]]",
        diffurl => "http://localhost/cgi-bin/hgwebdir.cgi/ikiwiki/diff/tip/\[[file]]",

1. I have noticed that running `ikiwiki` after a change to the wiki adds files to a directory called `recentchanges` under `$srcdir`. I don't understand why such files are needed; worse, they are not added to mercurial's list of tracked files, so they polute the output of `hg log`. Is this a bug? Should mercurial's commit hook be modified to add these files before the commit?

>> OK. I see two problems:

>> 1. If I clone my wiki, I won't get an exact copy of it: I will lose the recentchanges history. This could be an acceptable limitation but IMO this should be documented.

>> 2. The output of `hg status` is polluted. This could be solved trivially by adding a line containing `recentchanges` to `.hgignore`. Another alternative would be to store the `recentchanges` directory inside `$srdcir/.ikiwiki`.

>> I think the ideal solution would be to build `$destdir/recentchanges/*` directly from the output of `hg log`. --[[buo]]
