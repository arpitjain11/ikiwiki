Maybe sidebar could be beefed up to take the name of a sidebar, such that I could use multiple sidebars in the same wiki. For instance, the default name would be 'sidebar', meaning the plugin looks for `sidebar.pm` and fills in the `sidebar` slot, but I might also want a footer in `footer.pm`, filling the template's `footer` slot.

One good way (if possible) would be to provide a directive like `\[[!sidebar
id=sidebar]]` which would cause the file, in which it occurred to fill the
slot `SIDEBAR` in the template: basically, a page `foo.mdwn` says
`\[[!fillslot slot=myslot]]` and then its contents should go into `<TMPL_VAR
SLOT_MYSLOT>` for all pages. Ideally, this can then be overridden, so if
`/bar/foo.mdwn` also references `myslot` then pages under `/bar` should get
those contents instead.
