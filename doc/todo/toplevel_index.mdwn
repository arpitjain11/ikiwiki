Some inconsistences around the toplevel [[index]] page:

* [[ikiwiki]] is a separate page; links to [[ikiwiki]] should better go to
  the [[index]] though.

* The toplevel [[ikiwiki/Discussion]] page has some weird parentlinks
  behavior. This could be special cased around with the following patch.
  However, I'm unsure if I like the idea of more special cases around this.
  It would be better to find a way to make the toplevel index page not be a
  special case at all.

Here is a patch:

	--- IkiWiki/Render.pm   (revision 1187)
	+++ IkiWiki/Render.pm   (working copy)
	@@ -71,6 +71,7 @@

	+       $path=".." if $page=~s/^index\///;
	        foreach my $dir (reverse split("/", $page)) {
	                if (! $skip) {
	                        $path.="../";
