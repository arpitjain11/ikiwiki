Sometimes you want to match a page only if it has certain properties. The use
case I have in mind is this: show me all the pages that have children. You
can't do that with a pagespec, so I created a plugin that adds some pagespec
functions.

`match_relative(blah)` will match a page x if a pagespec from x would match 
`blah`. This is only actually useful with relative pagespecs.

`match_has_child(blah)` will match a child if it has a descendant named 
`blah`. If blah is empty, any child will match.

So if I have:

* foo
* foo/blah
* foo/bar
* foo/bar/blah
* foo/bar/bahoo
* foo/baz
* foo/baz/goo
* foo/baz/goo/blah

A pagespec `match_relative(./blah)` will match `foo/bar/bahoo`, because
a pagespec of `./blah` from `bahoo` would match `foo/bar/blah`. A
pagespec of `match_has_child(blah)` would match `foo`, `foo/bar`,
`foo/baz`, and `foo/baz/goo`.

Note that if you try to inline `*/blah` you will match `foo/blah`,
`foo/bar/blah`, and `foo/baz/goo/blah` -- that is, the blah pages 
themselves rather than any relatives of theirs.

This patch is useful for (among other things) constructing blogging 
systems where leaf nodes are organized hierarchically; using `has_child`,
you can inline only leaf nodes and ignore "intermediate" nodes.
`match_relative` can be used recursively to match properties of arbitrary
complexity: "show me all the pages who have children called foo that 
have children called blah". I'm not sure what use it is, though.

You can see the patch in action at

so named because I had hoped that something in conditional.pm could 
help me. I know the name "relative" sucks, feel free to come up with a 
better one. --Ethan
