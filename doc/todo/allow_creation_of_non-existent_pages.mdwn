With a statement such as

  ErrorDocument 404 /wiki/cgi-bin/ikiwiki?do=create

in `apache`'s configuration, I think that it would be possible to let the user surf to non-existent pages and be prompted to create an entry, as it is with other popular wiki engines.

From the [apache documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/custom-error.html), it seems that the environment variable `REDIRECT_URL` will carry the name of the page the user has accessed. Also see [ErrorDocument](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errordocument)'s documentation.
