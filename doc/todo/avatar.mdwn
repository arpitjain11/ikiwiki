[[!tag wishlist]]

It would be nice if ikiwiki, particularly [[plugins/comments]]
supported user avatar icons. I was considering adding a directive for this,
as designed below.

However, there is no *good* service for mapping openids to avatars --
openavatar has many issues, including not supporting delegated openids, and
after trying it, I don't trust it to push users toward. 
Perhaps instead ikiwiki could get the email address from the openid
provider, though I think the perl openid modules don't support the openid
2.x feature that allows that.

At the moment, working on this doesn't feel like a good use of my time.

Hmm.. unless is just always used a single provider (gravatar) and hashed
the openid. Then wavatars could be used to get a unique avatar per openid
at least. --[[Joey]] 

----

The directive displays a small avatar image for a user. Pass it the
email address, openid, or wiki username of the user.

	\[[!avatar user@example.com]]
	\[[!avatar http://joey.kitenet.net/]]
	\[[!avatar user]]

The avatars are provided by various sites. For email addresses, it uses a
[gravatar](http://gravatar.com/). For openid,
[openavatar](http://www.openvatar.com/) is used. For a wiki username, the
user's email address is looked up and the gravatar for that user is
displayed. (Of course, the user has to have filled in their email address
on their Preferences page for that to work.)

An optional second parameter can be included, containing additional
options to pass in the 
[gravatar url](http://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/url).
For example, this asks for a smaller gravatar, and if a user does
not have a gravatar, uses a cute auto-generated "wavatar" avatar.

	\[[!gravatar user@example.com "size=40&default=wavatar"]]

The `gravitar_options` setting in the setup file can be used to
specify additional options to pass. So for example if you want
to use wavatars everywhere, set it to "default=wavatar".
