Perhaps ikiwiki should support XML-RPC-based blogging, using the [standard
MetaWeblog protocol](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi).  This would allow
the use of applets like [[!debpkg gnome-blog]] to post to an ikiwiki blog.  The
protocol supports multiple blog names, so one standard URL with page names as
blog names would work. --[[JoshTriplett]]

>> I'd love to see support for this and would be happy to contribute towards a bounty (say US$100) :-).  [PmWiki](http://www.pmwiki.org/) has a plugin which [implements this](http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/XMLRPC) in a way which seems fairly sensible as an end user.  --[[AdamShand]]
