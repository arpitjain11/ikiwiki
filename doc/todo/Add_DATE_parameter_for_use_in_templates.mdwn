I sometimes want to inline things with the complete date and time, and
sometimes need only the date. I know about the prettydate plugin that
already makes the time a bit "nicer" to read, but sometimes I just
don't want it at all.

Here's a patch to add a DATE parameter for use in templates as
controlled by a Tdateformat setting in the setup.

I explicitly did not edit any date-related plugins, (for fear of
breaking them as I don't use them so I wouldn't be testing them). But
it occurs to me that it might be correct to not touch them anyway,
(since things like prettydate are really more concerned with changing
the presentation of the time, not the date).

I also didn't edit the sample setup file, (since I'm just using a git
repository setup on my local /usr/share/perl5/IkiWiki directory
here). But, ah, now that I look, I do see that there's a "real" git
repository advertised with the ikiwiki source. I'll have to start
using that for future patches, (so let me know if you want me to
regenerate this one against that).
