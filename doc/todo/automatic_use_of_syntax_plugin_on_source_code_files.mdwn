[[Wishlist]]: optionally use the [[plugins/contrib/syntax]] plugin
automatically on source code files in the repository with recognized
extensions or shebangs, and render them as though they consisted of an
[[.mdwn|ikiwiki/markdown]] page containing nothing but a single call to the syntax
plugin with the file contents as the text argument and the recognized type
as the type argument.

Together with the ability to have
[[wiki-formatted_comments|wiki-formatted_comments_with_syntax_plugin]],
this would allow the use of ikiwiki for [[wikipedia literate programming]].

* I have started something along these lines see [[plugins/contrib/sourcehighlight]].  For some reason I started with source-highlight [[DavidBremner]]
