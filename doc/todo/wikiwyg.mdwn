[Wikiwyg](http://www.wikiwyg.net/)
is a WYSIWYG editor written in javascript for wikis. It allows editing in a
gui or in wikitext and converts edits back to wiki format to be saved to
the wiki.

It would be awesome to use this in ikiwiki, but to take full advantage of
it with ikiwiki, it would need to know about MarkDown. Wikiwyg does allow
defining the text that is stuck on each side of a given html element to
make it wikified, for example, it can add "# " for a h1, "[[" and "]]" for
a link, etc. This seems easily doable.

The other thing that would need doing is a `saveChanges` function would
need to be implemented that saves the text back to ikiwiki. 
http://svn.wikiwyg.net/code/trunk/wikiwyg/share/Kwiki/lib/Wikiwyg/Kwiki.js
seems like a good starting point for building a submit form on the fly.

One other problem: Wikiwyg works by parsing html from a div, turning it
back into the wiki markup, and editing/saving that. That seems to assume
that there's a way of parsing a page's html and getting back to the underlying
wiki markup, which is not always the case in ikiwiki. Unless there's some 
other way to feed it the actual source for a page, this seems like a
problem. According to the developers, it is possible to do that, and start
off in WikiText mode.
