I think there is a problem in my "dependency graph". As an example, 
[here](http://poivron.org/~nil/misc/ikiwiki_buggy_index) is the index 
ikiwiki generated for [my site](http://poivron.org/~nil/misc/ikiwiki_buggy_index)
(note that the site changed since this index was generated).

Some **HUGE** dependencies appear, clearly non optimal, like

    depends = A｜ B | A | C | A | D | A | E | A | F | A | G | ....

or 

    depends= A | B | C | D | A | B | C | D | A | B | C | D | ....

Couldn't isolate the cause, but some sources for this problem may be:

* related to the img module
* easily observable in my sire because one of my pages includes 80 resized images

Other special things in my templates and site:

* a sidebar with \[[include pages="notes/\*" template=foo]] while notes.mdwn has 
  a \[[include pages="notes/*"]] and uses the sidebar; removed it, doesn't change
* a template (biblio.tmpl) calling the "img" plugin with a template parameter as the
  image filename; removed it, doesn't change
* some strange games with tags whose page calls a "map" directive to show other tags
  shile tags are also used in tagclouds (in the sidebar and in the main pages)
* ...

I observed these problems (same *kind*, I didn't check in details) on
 
* ikiwiki 2.00gpa1 + v5.8.4 + Debian 3.1
* ikiwiki 2.3 + v5.8.8 + Ubuntu 7.04

I can think about reducung the size of my wiki source and making it available online for analysis.
