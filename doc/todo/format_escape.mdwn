Since some preprocessor directives insert raw HTML, it would be good to 
specify, per-format, how to pass HTML so that it goes through the format 
OK. With Markdown we cross our fingers; with reST we use the "raw" 
directive.

I added an extra named parameter to the htmlize hook, which feels sort of
wrong, since none of the other hooks take parameters. Let me know what 
you think. --Ethan

Seems fairly reasonable, actually. Shouldn't the `$type` come from `$page`
instead of `$destpage` though? Only other obvious change is to make the
escape parameter optional, and only call it if set. --[[Joey]]

## Alternative solution

[Here](http://www.jk.fr.eu.org/ikiwiki/format-escapes-2.diff) is a patch
largely inspired from the one below, which is up to date and written with
[[todo/multiple_output_formats]] in mind. "htmlize" hooks are generalized
to "convert" ones, which can be registered for any pair of filename
extensions.

Preprocessor directives are allowed to return the content to be inserted
as a hash, in any format they want, provided they provide htmlize hooks for it.
Pseudo filename extensions (such as `"_link"`) can also be introduced,
which aren't used as real extensions but provide useful intermediate types.

### Updated patch

I've created an updated [patch](http://www.idletheme.org/code/patches/ikiwiki-format-escapes-rlk-2007-09-24.diff) against the current revision.  No real functionality changes, except for a small test script, one minor bugfix (put a "join" around a scalar-context "map" in convert_link), and some wrangling to get it merged properly; I thought it might be helpful for anyone else who wants to work on the code.

(With that out of the way, I think I'm going to take a stab at Jeremie's plan to use marks which would be replaced post-htmlization.  I've also got an eye towards [[todo/multiple_output_formats]].)
