Well, that would probably be fairly easy to add if it used [[pagespecs|ikiwiki/pagespec]] to
specify which pages use the non-default template.

Hmm, I think the [[pagetemplate|plugins/pagetemplate]] hook should allow one to get close enough to
this in a plugin now.

See also: [[Allow_per-page_template_selection]] -- same thing, really.
