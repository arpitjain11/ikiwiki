Given network access when building the wiki, ikiwiki could retrieve information from bug-tracking systems and apply that information to BTS links.  For instance, consider how links from one bugzilla bug to another use strikeout formatting for links to fixed bugs, and use the status and summary of the bug to the link as a title.

This seems somewhat difficult, as ikiwiki would need to maintain a cache of the remote BTS information, and know how to talk to various types of BTS.  CPAN modules exist to solve this problem for some types of BTS.
