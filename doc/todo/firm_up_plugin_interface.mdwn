I don't want this interface to be too firm; it's ok for a plugin like
`ddate` to redefine an internal function like IkiWiki::displaytime if it
wants to.. But plugins that still access stuff through IkiWiki:: should be
aware that that stuff can change at any time and break them. Possibly without
perl's type checking catching the breakage, in some cases. Plugins that
only use exported symbols should not be broken by future ikiwiki changes.

Functions used by only some plugins, undecided about exporting:

* lockwiki, unlockwiki (aggregate)
	Too internal to ever be exported.
* loadindex (aggregate)
	Too internal to ever be exported.
* titlepage (aggregate)
	Not until more than one thing uses it.
* basename (polygen, inline, search, polygen)
* dirname (linkmap, inline)
	For basename and dirname, they could just use standard perl library
	stuff. Howevever, ikiwiki's versions are slightly different and I'd
	need to check if the standard versions work for the uses made in
	these plugins. Inclined not to export.
* abs2rel (linkmap, inline)
	This *is* the library version, just optimised to work around a bug.
	Don't export this.
* possibly_foolish_untaint (aggregate, polygen)
	Probably better to implement yourself.
* htmlize
* linkify
* preprocess
* filter
	The 4 above are used by a few plugins, but problimatic since plugins 
	typically also define functions with these names.. I also feel that
	this part of ikiwiki needs some more work before it's set in stone.
	These are always called together, in the same order, though
	sometimes htmlize isn't included.

Variables used by plugins but not exported yet:

* %IkiWiki::pagecase (aggregate)
* %IkiWiki::backlinks (pagestats)
