Perhaps I'm just too stupid to find the proper way to do this, but how
would I add a new page to the wiki without selecting to edit an already
installed one and frobbing the URL to direct to the to-be-created page?

Good point. Of course one way is to start with creating a link to the page,
which also helps prevent orphans. But other wikis based on CGI do have this
a bit easier, since they can detect an attempt to access a nonexistant page
and show an edit page. Ikiwiki can't do that (unless its web server is
configured to do smart things on a 404, like maybe call ikiwiki.cgi which
could be modified to work as a smart 404 -> edit handler).

Some wikis also provide a UI means for creating a new page. If we can find
something good, that can be added to ikiwiki's UI. --[[Joey]]

Hmm, maybe just a preprocessor directive that creates a form inside a page,
like is used for blog posting already would suffice? Then the main page of
a wiki could have a form for adding new pages, if that directive were
included there. Won't work for subpages though, unless the directive were
added to the parent page. However, unconnected subpages are surely an even
rarer thing to want than unconnected top level pages. --[[Joey]]

Maybe a very simple PHP frontend for serving the
statically generated pages, that would display a page editing form or
something like that for non-existent pages, wouldn't be too bad a thing
and resource hog? Just a thought... --[[Tuomov]]
