The basewiki is a standard set of wiki pages that are included by default in
all wikis that ikiwiki builds, unless the wiki overrides them with its own
versions.

It currently includes these pages:

* [[index]]
* [[sandbox]]
* [[shortcuts]]
* [[templates]]
* [[ikiwiki/blog]]
* [[ikiwiki/formatting]]
* [[ikiwiki/markdown]]
* [[ikiwiki/openid]]
* [[ikiwiki/pagespec]]
* [[ikiwiki/directive]]
* [[ikiwiki/subpage]]
* [[ikiwiki/wikilink]]

As well as a few other files, like [[favicon.ico]], [[local.css]],
[[style.css]], and some icons.
