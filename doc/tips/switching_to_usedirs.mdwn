As of version 2.0, ikiwiki will switch to enabling the 'usedirs' setting by
default. This *will* break all URLs to wikis that did not have 'usedirs'
turned on before. You can either follow this procedure to convert your wiki
to usedirs, or edit your setup file and turn usedirs back off.

* Upgrade ikiwiki to 2.0.
* Force ikiwiki to rebuild your wiki, by using `ikiwiki-mass-rebuild`,
  or manually.
* Since usedirs is enabled, ikiwiki will have created a bunch of new
  html files. Where before ikiwiki generated a `dest/foo.html`, now it will
  generate `dest/foo/index.html`. But, the old html files will still be
  present too. Remove them:
	find dest -name \*.html -not -name index.html -exec rm {} \;
* If you have a blog that is aggregated on a Planet or similar, all the
  items in the RSS or atom feed will seem like new posts, since their URLs
  have changed. See [[howto_avoid_flooding_aggregators]] for a workaround.
* Now all the URLs to pages in your wiki have changed. See
  [[redirections_for_usedirs]] for instructions on setting up redirections
  to keep the old URLs working.
