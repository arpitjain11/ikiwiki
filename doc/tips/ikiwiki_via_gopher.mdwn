Remember gopher? Ikiwiki can be served up by this venerable protocol.

It's pretty simple to get it going. Just install pygopherd or another gopher
server, and have ikiwiki put its pages where that server expects. For
pygopherd, it was in `/var/gopher`.

When building the wiki, make sure to specify --no-usedirs (or equivilant in
the setup file). Gopher doesn't convert "foo/" links into
"foo/index.html", so usedirs won't work well with it; if usedirs is
disabled, browsing through the wiki via gopher will work just fine.

Since AFAIK gopher has no equivilant to CGI, you'll need to keep a
web server around for editing pages. If you do set up a cgi, make sure to
configure `url` to something like `gopher://hostname/h/`, so that it
links back properly to gopherspace from the CGI.

One unresolved problem: Style sheets are not loaded. The urls seem ok, but
pygopherd seems to serve them in a form that doesn't work somehow. I have
not invesitaged more, because a fully unstyled web page fits the retro
gopher better anyhow.
