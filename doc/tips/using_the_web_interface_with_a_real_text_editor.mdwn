If you use Firefox or Iceweasel, the [It's All
Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125) extension allows
you to use a real text editor like Emacs or Vim to edit the contents of text
areas.  This allows you to edit ikiwiki pages with a real text editor through
the ikiwiki web interface, rather than only with direct commit 
access. --[[JoshTriplett]] 

For Firefox or Iceweasel users, the vimperator extension is also a good
idea.  You can press Ctrl-I in the insert mode of vimperator and switch to
an external editor, e.g. Vim. --[[WeakishJiang]]

Finally, with wikis configured to allow, [[untrusted_git_push]], you can
ditch the browser altogether. --[[Joey]]
