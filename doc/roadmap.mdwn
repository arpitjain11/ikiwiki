This is the roadmap for ikiwiki development.

# 1.0

* No severe [[security]] bugs.
* All the basic [[features]] people would expect in a wiki.

Released 29 April 2006.

The 1.x series changed a great deal over the more than 50 releases in its
lifetime. It is now in maintenance mode, only security issues or really bad
bugs will be fixed in 1.x going forward.

----

# 2.0

* New improved URLs to pages via `usedirs`.
* [[plugins/OpenID]] support, enabled by default.
* Plugin [[interface|plugins/write]] added, with some 60 [[plugins]] available,
  greatly expanding the capabilities of ikiwiki.
* [[Tags]], atom feeds, and generally full-fledged blogging support.
* Fully working [[todo/utf8]].
* Optimisations, approximately 3.5 times as fast as version 1.0.
* Improved scalability to large numbers of pages.
* Improved scalable [[logo]].
* Support for additional revision control systems besides svn: git,
  tla, mercurial.
* Some support for other markup languages than markdown: rst, textile.
* Unit test suite, with more than 300 tests.

Released 30 April 2007.

The 2.x series is expected to undergo continuing development for some time,
adding improvements and new features, but avoiding changes that break
backwards compatability.

----

# 3.0

Still in the early planning stages, version 3.0 will be an opportunity to
make significant transitions.

* Default to using prefix_directives.

----

# future goals

* Improved [[todo/html]] stylesheets and templates.
  _(status: [[css_market]] exists; it could always provide more stylesheets.  No alternate templates yet, though.)_
* More documentation in the basewiki, including documentation for all enabled plugins.  Probably need some solution for [[todo/conditional_underlay_files]], too.
* Conversion support for existing other wikis.
  (Being worked on for MoinMoin and TWiki by [[Josh_Triplett|JoshTriplett]]
  and Jamey Sharp; support for other wikis should fit into the same
  framework.)
* [[TODO]], [[bugs]], [[soc]], ...
