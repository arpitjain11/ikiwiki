I can't check the last changes in Ikiwiki using
[gitweb](http://git.ikiwiki.info/?p=ikiwiki). It looks like XML
validation problem with HTML entity.

When I click a appropriate link on a [[git]] page, then I can only
see the following error message. --[[Paweł|ptecza]]

    <div class="title">&nbsp;</div>
