#Ikiwiki plugin for the Monotone revision control system.

I've just made a patch to the ikiwiki code that allows it to use the [[rcs/Monotone]] revision control system.  It is available at:

<http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~willu/monotone-ikiwiki.diff>

At the moment it is basically complete.  At present rcs_notify() is implemeted but untested, the rest is implemented and tested.

The current version of the patch handles conflicts through the web interface.  It is still not perfect as it will break if there is a rename that conflicts with a web change (but so will the other Rcs plugins I think).  It also commits a revision with conflict markers if there is a conflict requiring such markers... ick.

Note: This patch requires a rather recent Monotone perl module (18 August 2007 or later).  It is available from the monotone repository here: <http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net/branch/changes/net.venge.monotone>.

Here is another patch.  It fixes a FIXME you added.  I was using $file within backticks because
I was getting an error trying to do it right.  I've figured out the error, and now do it right.  This
should also speed things up (very slightly)

I've just done this further development...  The following patch adds support for diffurls.
I've also partially tested the commit message support.  I was unable to get Ikiwiki to send
change emails at all (cgi or otherwise), so I tested by adding warn() calls.  There were a
few things that needed to be fixed.  Support is much closer now (including a simple default
monotone lua hook).
