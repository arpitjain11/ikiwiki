The Atom and RSS templates use `ESCAPE=HTML` in the title elements. However, HTML-escaped characters aren't valid according to <http://feedvalidator.org/>.

Removing `ESCAPE=HTML` works fine, but I haven't checked to see if there are any characters it won't work for.

For Atom, at least, I believe adding `type="xhtml"` to the title element will work. I don't think there's an equivalent for RSS.
