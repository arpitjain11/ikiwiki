If I create a page whose title contains an apostrophe, then inlining that
page produces nothing.  It looks like the inline plugin is failing to do
the translation from apostrophe to `_39_` that other parts of the system do, so although one can make wikilinks to such pages and have them detected as existing (for instance, by the conditional plugin), inline looks in the wrong place and doesn't see the page.
