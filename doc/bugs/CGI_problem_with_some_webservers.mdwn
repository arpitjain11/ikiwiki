The "ikwiki.cgi?page=index&do=edit" function has a problem
when running with [[!debpkg thttpd]] or [[!debpkg mini-httpd]]:
for some reason the headers ikiwiki outputs are transmitted
as the page content. Surprisingly, the "do=prefs" function
works as expected.

Here is what it looks like in iceweasel:

    Set-Cookie: ikiwiki_session_apnkit=99dad8d796bc6c819523649ef25ea447; path=/
    Date: Tue, 14 Aug 2007 17:16:32 GMT

     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
    <html>
    (...)

Ikiwiki runs fine with [[!debpkg boa]].

It doesn't work for signin either.
What is the reason for these "header => 1" in FormBuilder initialisations?
Why do they appear two times with conflicting values in the very same hashes?

Marking [[done]] since it's not really an ikiwiki bug. --[[Joey]]
